#GAME OF RUST

###Motivation
To learn myself a bit of Rust, not overthink it and have fun.

###Features
- Play/Pause sim [SPACE]
- Sim speed control (range x1 - x60) [MOUSE WHEEL]
- Random starting contidions (30% infill) [R & on launch]
- Manualy toggle cell when paused [LMB]

###Limitations
- 100x100 grid without looping
- hardcoded max sim speed (coffee cargo thing)

###Road map (of sorts, not in order)
- [ ] Zoom with mouse wheel & draggable simspace
- [ ] Dynamic size, growing (up to a point) playspace
- [ ] Common pattern recognition and coloring
- [ ] Pause on selected pattern emergence
 [ ] ✨ Cell crossing mode ✨
