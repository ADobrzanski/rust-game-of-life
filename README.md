# GAME OF RUST
You know the rules and so do I :)

## Motivation
To learn myself a bit of Rust and not overthink.
I'm also reviving my joy of programming I've been missing lately so then there's that.

## Features
- Play/Pause sim [SPACE]
- Sim speed control (range x1 - x60) [MOUSE WHEEL]
- Random starting contidions (30% infill) [R & on launch]
- Manualy toggle cell when paused [LMB]

## Current limitations
- 100x100 grid without looping (will get changed at some point)
- hardcoded max sim speed (coffee cargo thing)

## Road map (of sorts, not in order)
- [ ] 🔍 Zoom with mouse wheel & draggable simspace
- [ ] 💹 Dynamic size, growing (up to a point), looping playspace
- [ ] 👀 Common pattern recognition and coloring
- [ ] 💡 Pause on selected pattern emergence
- [ ] ✨ Cell crossing mode ✨
